# Implementation of Door Bell on Zynq-7000

A digital design project that simulates a doorbell system using VHDL. The bell activates only when both the power switch and the button are pressed ('1'). This project was developed to practice behavioral modeling, RTL simulation, and synthesis using Xilinx Vivado. The design was successfully implemented on a Zynq-7000 FPGA board.
