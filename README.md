# Implementation-of-DoorBell-on-Zynq-7000-
A digital design project that simulates a doorbell system using VHDL. The bell activates only when the power switch and the button are pressed ('1'). This project was developed to practice behavioral modeling, RTL simulation, and synthesis using Xilinx Vivado. The design was successfully implemented on an FPGA board.
